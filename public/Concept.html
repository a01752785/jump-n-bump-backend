        Concept/Idea <br>
    </h2> <br>

    <p style="font-family:courier;">This project is focused on helping young percussionists <br>
        to acquire and refine their psycho-motor skills <br>
        used in a highly precise environment of performing music. <br> <br>
        The game shows how dangerous a hearing loss could be, by our hearing loss simulation <br>
        equalized following an audiogram to simulate the hearing from a person with hearing loss. <br>
